# Unity-JammerTools
Unity Tools and Subsystems from Game Jam games I made :)

Modules
  * Music Manager with pooling, fadeout transitions and stinger transitions
  * Simple Grid Coordinates system with editor snapping
  * A Simple Inheritance-Based State Machine
  * A Lootbox/Booster Generator!
  * A Singleton Helper
  * More random stuff I find useful!
  
I used [thefuntastic's Unity Object Pool](https://github.com/thefuntastic/unity-object-pool) for the Music Manager. Originally it used Zenject, but I adapted it can be used in non-zenject projects


There's a sample showing how to use the Music system, I wanted to make more of those for the rest, but hopefully for now the systems are simple enough to understand by just reading the code
